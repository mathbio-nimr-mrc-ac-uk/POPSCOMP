# POPSCOMP
POPS computes solvent accessible surface areas (SASAs) of biomolecules (protein, DNA/RNA).

POPSCOMP is running on the [POPScomp server](http://popscomp.org:3838),
the code and additional information is provided in Fraternali lab's GitHub repository 
[POPScomp](https://github.com/Fraternalilab/POPScomp).

Originally, the POPSCOMP server was hosted at mathbio.ninmr.mrc.ac.uk
and temporarily at mathbio.crick.mrc.ac.uk .
