# POPSCOMP
POPS applied to biomolecular complexes to compute buried surface areas.

The POPSCOMP program is now hosted as Fraternali lab's GitHub repository 
[POPScomp](https://github.com/Fraternalilab/POPScomp).

The original and now discontinued POPS server was running at mathbio.ninmr.mrc.ac.uk.
